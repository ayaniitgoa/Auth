You can also test your ability in a contest that will follow, where you’ll be asked to design a chat-bot of your own adhering to the given problem statement, so you never have to worry about having no one to talk to.",

You’ll greatly enhance the python coder you have within you, along with also learning many different automated tasks you can do with python. Yeah, you heard it right, Automated! These include repetitive mundane tasks like taking backup of your system, sending emails, sending WhatsApp messages to a list of contacts, prioritising tasks, segregating stuff and much more.",

You’ll also learn how to install Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL), and after that you’ll smoothly wander in the commands of linux, which go way beyond just navigation in the terminal. If you got any queries regarding these things, this hands-on workshop is the best opportunity for you to clear them up!",
